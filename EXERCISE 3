; EXERCISE 3

; Question 3: Add the following two lines to the definitions area:

;(define str "helloworld")
;(define i 5)

;Then create an expression using string primitives that adds "_" at position i. In general this means the resulting string is longer than the original one; here the expected result is "hello_world".
;Position means i characters from the left of the string, but programmers start counting at 0. Thus, the 5th letter in this example is "w", because the 0th letter is "h".

(define str "helloworld")
(define ind "0123456789") ; the index helps us count the expected extracted value.
(define i 5) 

; Use function (string-ith); which, consumes a string s together with a number i and extracts the 1String located at the ith position (counting from 0).

(string-ith str i)

; Since i = 5, we are extracting from the fifth position of the string (w).
; Expected output: "w"

(check-expect (string-ith str i) "w")

; The test passed!
