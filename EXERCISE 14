; Exercise 14:
; Define the function string-last, which extracts the last 1String from a non-empty string.

; can't use string-ith this time. All strings have a uniform value for its first position, the same
; can't be said for it's last. ex: Dog (g=3), Bear (r=4)

(define (string-last str)
  (substring str (- (string-length str) 1)))

; we -1 from the string length and extract said value.

(string-last "ADVENTURE") ;E
(string-last "nice guys finish last") ;t
(string-last "Hobbit") ;t

(check-expect (string-last "ADVENTURE") "E")
