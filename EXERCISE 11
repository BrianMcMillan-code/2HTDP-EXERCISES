; QUESTION 11

; EXERCISE 11: define a function that consumes two numbers, x and y,
; and that computes the distance of point (x,y) to the origin.
; In exercise 1 you developed the right-hand side of this function
; for concrete values of x and y. Now add a header.

(define (DIS x y) ; distance to origin
  (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))

(DIS 3 4)

; write (DIS x? y?) to get an answer.
; for (DIS 3 4), expected value is 5.

(check-expect (DIS 3 4) 5)
