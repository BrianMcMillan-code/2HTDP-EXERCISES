; EXERCISE 1.

; QUESTION: Exercise 1. Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacket’s definitions area:

; (define x 3)
; (define y 4)

; Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point. Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin, that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).
; The expected result for these values is 5, but your expression should produce the correct result even after you change these definitions.


(define x 3)
(define y 4)

; Now, in the interactions area, test the program.
; EX: > (+ x 10). Expected output: 13
; EX: > (* x y). Expected output: 12

; (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))) --> this takes the square-root of x^2 + y^2.

(sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))

; Expected output: 5

(check-expect (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))) 5)

; Test passed!
